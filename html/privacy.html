      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>GameVault</strong>. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our website, Telegram bot, and related services.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We may collect personal details such as your name, email address, and Telegram username when you contact us, request a game, or interact with our bot.
      </p>

      <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        Your information is used solely to provide, maintain, and improve our services — for example, responding to your messages or processing your game requests. We do not sell or share your data with third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement strong security measures to protect your information. However, no online service is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute protection.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Cookies</h2>

        GameVault may use cookies to improve your browsing experience. You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but some parts of the website may not function properly.

      <p>
        You have the right to request access to or deletion of your data at any time by contacting us via the <a href="contact.html">Contact Page</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Updates to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. When we do, the updated version will be posted on this page with a new “Last Updated” date.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
